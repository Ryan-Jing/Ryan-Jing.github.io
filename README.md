# Ryan Jing's Portfolio

Here is my website to display some of my work and current projects! I want to show all of my passions both in my academicsy/career and in my hobbies. I hope that after visiting my website you can get to know me a bit better!

I'm still learning all these languages and tools so the code is extremely messy and unclean. If you have any recommendations on how I can improve my website, please reach out!
