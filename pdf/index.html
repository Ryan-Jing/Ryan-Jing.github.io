                        Developed a functional hand prosthetic prototype using EMG processing. Designed custom analog filter circuit to capture muscle signals from skin surface electrodes, outputting digital logic to an Arduino that processes these signals to actuate servo motors in a 3D-printed claw hand designed in SolidWorks.

                    <h4>EMG-Controlled Hand Prosthetic</h4>
                    <p>Developed with a partner a functional hand prosthetic prototype designed for upper-limb amputees, combining analog signal processing, and mechanical design to create a biometric control interface.</p>

                    <p><strong>Analog Signal Processing:</strong> Designed and implemented a custom analog filter circuit to process electromyography (EMG) signals captured from skin surface electrodes placed on the forearm. The circuit filters muscle activation signals, amplifies them to a usable range, and passes the conditioned signal to a comparator that outputs a digital high/low signal corresponding to forearm flexion and extension.</p>

                    <p>Programmed an Arduino microcontroller to interpret the comparator output and control servo motors that actuate the prosthetic fingers. The firmware implements threshold detection, and debouncing for stable operation.</p>

                    <p>Partner designed the complete prosthetic hand mechanism in SolidWorks, optimizing for printability, weight, and range of motion. The claw design features articulating fingers driven by a tendon-based actuation system, all fabricated using 3D printing for rapid prototyping and iteration. The integration of electronics, motors, and mechanical linkages was carefully planned to fit within a compact, wearable form factor.</p>

                    <h4>Portable DJ Mixing System</h4>
                    <p>Developed a fully functional, portable DJ mixing system built from cardboard with integrated hardware controls and real-time audio processing capabilities. This project combined embedded systems engineering, audio signal processing, and full-stack web development to create a standalone music mixing solution that operates independently of network connectivity.</p>

                    <p><strong>Hardware Architecture:</strong> The system is built around an ESP32 microcontroller running FreeRTOS, managing multiple hardware inputs including buttons, rotary encoders, and potentiometers. The firmware handles hardware interrupts for responsive button actions and implements I2C communication protocol to transmit control signals to a Raspberry Pi 5. The multi-threaded architecture ensures real-time performance without input lag.</p>

                    <p><strong>Audio Processing:</strong> The Raspberry Pi 5 serves as the audio processing engine, receiving control inputs from the ESP32 via I2C and applying real-time audio effects including mixing, EQ adjustments, crossfading, and tempo modulation. The system outputs processed audio to Bluetooth devices such as wireless headphones, enabling completely portable operation without requiring Wi-Fi connectivity.</p>

                    <p><strong>Web Interface & Spotify Integration:</strong> Developed a custom web application with a backend API that integrates with Spotify's API for playlist management. Users authenticate their Spotify account, browse their playlists through an intuitive interface, and select tracks for download. The backend handles secure authentication, playlist retrieval, and local audio file management on the Raspberry Pi 5, ensuring all music is available offline for mixing sessions in any location.</p>

                    <p>This project demonstrates proficiency in embedded C/C++ development, real-time operating systems, hardware communication protocols, audio DSP, full-stack web development, and system integration across multiple platforms.</p>
