This project combined embedded systems engineering, audio signal processing, and full-stack web development to create a standalone music mixing solution that operates independently of network connectivity.</p><p><strong>Hardware Architecture:</strong> The system is built around an ESP32 microcontroller running FreeRTOS, managing multiple hardware inputs including buttons, rotary encoders, and potentiometers. The firmware handles hardware interrupts for responsive button actions and implements I2C communication protocol to transmit control signals to a Raspberry Pi 5. The multi-threaded architecture ensures real-time performance without input lag.</p><p><strong>Audio Processing:</strong> The Raspberry Pi 5 serves as the audio processing engine, receiving control inputs from the ESP32 via I2C and applying real-time audio effects including mixing, EQ adjustments, crossfading, and tempo modulation. The system outputs processed audio to Bluetooth devices such as wireless headphones, enabling completely portable operation without requiring Wi-Fi connectivity.</p><p><strong>Web Interface & Spotify Integration:</strong> Developed a custom web application with a backend API that integrates with Spotify\u2019s API for playlist management. Users authenticate their Spotify account, browse their playlists through an intuitive interface, and select tracks for download. The backend handles secure authentication, playlist retrieval, and local audio file management on the Raspberry Pi 5, ensuring all music is available offline for mixing sessions in any location.</p><p>This project demonstrates proficiency in embedded C/C++ development, real-time operating systems, hardware communication protocols, audio DSP, full-stack web development, and system integration across multiple platforms.</p>"}, "assets/projects/DJ/DJ_Video.mov", {"src": "assets/projects/DJ/DJ_Box.jpeg", "text": "Complete DJ box assembly showing cardboard construction and control layout"}, {"src": "assets/projects/DJ/DJ_Wire.jpeg", "text": "Internal electronics - ESP32 wiring and hardware integration"}, {"src": "assets/projects/DJ/DJ_Group.jpeg", "text": "Team presentation showcasing the final working prototype"}]'>
